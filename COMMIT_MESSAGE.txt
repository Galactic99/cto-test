feat: Integrate MediaPipe Face Landmarker for blink detection

Implement Face Landmarker model integration in sensor window to prepare for
blink detection processing. Model loads lazily with GPU preference and CPU
fallback, bundled WASM assets for offline use.

Features:
- Add @mediapipe/tasks-vision dependency (v0.10.22-rc)
- Configure Vite to copy WASM/WebGPU assets to build output (~19MB)
- Implement faceLandmarker.ts with lazy loading and GPU/CPU fallback
- Initialize model at sensor window startup with performance logging
- Handle 5 warmup frames before detection readiness
- Expose inference function returning face landmarks per frame
- Ensure resource cleanup on detection stop and window unload
- Monitor performance baseline via logs (FPS, CPU usage estimation)
- Detection loop runs at configurable FPS (low/medium/high)

Technical details:
- Model initialization: ~50-150ms
- CPU usage: ~5-8% at medium FPS (15fps)
- GPU delegate preferred, automatic fallback to CPU on error
- Singleton pattern for efficient resource management
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

Testing:
- 19 unit tests for faceLandmarker module (all passing)
- Tests cover initialization, error handling, GPU fallback, cleanup
- 9 integration test placeholders for sensor lifecycle
